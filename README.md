# iyas.ai
iyas.ai (from the Japanese word 'iyasu', which means healing) is a recommender system for books and stories that could help you and your loved ones lift up your mood whenever you are facing stress or unpleasant situations. Just type in how you are feeling and we will suggest a (few) books or stories that might just brighten up your day.<br>

I have deployed it on Google Cloud App Engine and you can try it here: [iyasai.me]

The datasets used to build iyas.ai come from 2 sources:
* Goodreads: I scraped 50000 books from Goodreads' 'Best Books Ever' list with their titles, authors, and descriptions.
* The Novel Cure by Ella Berthoud and Susan Elderkin: this is where the inspiration for this project came from. Ella and Susan have created a marvelous list of books for you to read through your difficult times. However, there are only 751 books mentioned in The Novel Cure. I believe no literary experts could have read through the entirety of human literature, and so some machine learning 'magic' could step in and help guide you through your search for the perfect books.

Enjoy :D
